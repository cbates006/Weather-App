# Weather App

## Project Description
This is a basic weather app made for Application Development II 2024 at Drury University. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to display up-to-date weather data relative to the user's current location. It furthermore uses MySQL to create a backend database that allows users to create their own accounts and save data to be displayed within the app. 

## Setup
- Clone the repository
- Run "npm install" to update all packages
- Install Expo v53.0.0 using "npm install expo@53.0.0"
- Run "npm start" to start the application
- Open the app on an Android emulator or scan the QR code with a device that has the ExpoGO application installed
